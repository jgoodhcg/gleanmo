# Memento Mori Calendar

## Work Unit Summary
- Status: idea
- Problem / intent: Provide a memento mori view that emphasizes finite time (weeks or months remaining) and anchors it to real calendar data.
- Constraints: Must be visually lightweight, not a duplicate of the life chart, and should integrate with existing calendar events where useful.
- Proposed approach: Build a grid-based view (weeks or months) with the current position highlighted, optional overlays (life periods, milestones), and links back to the main calendar and life chart.
- Open questions: Should this live inside the life chart feature or stand alone? What is the primary granularity (weeks vs months)? Which overlays matter most?

## Notes
### Possible integrations
- Pull milestone markers from calendar events or life periods.
- Offer a simple configuration for expected lifespan or target horizon.
- Keep the UI minimal and emphasize legibility over density.
