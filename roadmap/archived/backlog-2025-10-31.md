# Backlog Archive – 2025-03-09

Documenting backlog items that were completed and removed from `roadmap/backlog.md` on 2025-03-09.

## Generic Components

### Dark-themed Database Tables
- **Goal achieved:** `/app/db/*` tables now follow the dark theme gradients, borders, and hover interactions.
- **Notes:** Matches the design language requested in the backlog and aligns with the 2025-10-23 implementation update.

## Entity-Specific Improvements

### Medication Logs
- **Unit expansion:** Added support for milliliters and a broader set of practical dosage units (`:capsule`, `:tablet`, `:pill`, `:drop`, `:sprays`, `:units`, `:glob`, `:patch`, `:puff`).
- **Catch-all option:** Introduced an `:other` enum value so oddball measurements can still be recorded without schema changes.
- **Schema reference:** See `src/tech/jgood/gleanmo/schema/medication_schema.clj`.

### Meditation Timer – Stop Timer Redirect
- **Flow complete:** The `stop-timer` handler now stamps `end` timestamps and issues a 303 redirect straight to the relevant CRUD edit form with a `redirect` parameter back to the timer dashboard (`src/tech/jgood/gleanmo/timer/routes.clj:190-214`).
- **Benefit:** Immediately after stopping a session you can add notes, adjust durations, and then land back on `/app/timer/{entity}` without manually navigating.
- **Notes:** This closes out the “stop timer enhancement” item that previously lived in `roadmap/backlog.md`.

## Historical Notes
- For prior implementation context (2025-10-23) see the archived updates in this file instead of the active backlog.
