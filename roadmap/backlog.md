# Backlog

Minor improvements and enhancements that don't warrant separate requirement documents.

## Work Unit Summary
- Problem / intent: Capture minor improvements without spinning up full work-unit docs.
- Constraints: Keep it lightweight and move completed items to `roadmap/archived/`.
- Proposed approach: Organize by area (CRUD, UI, performance, components) and promote items that grow in scope.
- Open questions: Which items are big enough to graduate into their own roadmap files?

_Completed items are moved to `roadmap/archived/`; see `roadmap/archived/backlog-2025-03-09.md` for the latest archive entry._

## CRUD System Redesign
The current CRUD views (generated by crud/routes) need a major overhaul:

**Issues:**
- Take up excessive screen space with poor information density
- Display redundant information across columns  
- Poor visual styling that doesn't match the app's design language
- Lack utility features for efficient data management

**Improvements Needed:**
- **Compact layout**: Higher information density, better use of space
- **Smart columns**: Hide/show relevant fields based on entity type
- **Visual consistency**: Match the app's design system and styling
- **Utility features**: Bulk operations, filtering, sorting, search
- **Responsive design**: Work well on mobile and desktop
- **Action buttons**: More intuitive edit/delete/view controls
- **Data formatting**: Better display of dates, booleans, relationships
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large datasets

**Technical Approach:**
- Consider table virtualization for large datasets
- Implement column customization (hide/show/reorder)
- Add inline editing capabilities
- Improve form layouts within the CRUD system
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Generic Components

### Fuzzy Search Component
Reusable search component with fuzzy matching for entity selection across forms and interfaces
- Support for multiple entity types (projects, exercises, locations, etc.)
- Keyboard navigation and mobile-friendly interface
- Configurable search fields and display formatting
- Recent/frequent item prioritization

## Dashboard UI

### Recent List View Visual Refresh
Improve the main dashboard recent list view with better information density, clearer hierarchy, and more deliberate visual styling.

## Performance / Queries

### Habit Labels Query Optimization
Reduce O(n) request patterns when fetching habit labels. Target a single query (or two at most) for label data instead of one request per habit.

## Code Quality

### Linting Setup
- Configure and run linting tools (clj-kondo, cljfmt)
- Update AGENTS.md with linting commands
- Establish linting rules for codebase consistency
- Pre-commit hooks for automated linting

## Entity-Specific Improvements

### Project Colors
Add optional color field to projects for visual organization and differentiation.
- **Schema**: Add `:project/color {:optional true} :string` storing hex code
- **UI**: Constrained color picker in CRUD forms (8-12 preset colors)
- **Display**: Show color indicator in project lists and detail views
- **Rationale**: Visual differentiation helps scanning 18+ projects efficiently

### Meditation Timer
- **Form pre-population bug**: Creating a timer for a specific meditation doesn't prefill the meditation selection in the form
  - Root cause: `start-timer-card` constructs query param as `meditation-log/meditation-id` but actual field is `meditation-log/type-id`
  - Fix: Use `relationship-key` from config instead of constructing field name from `parent-entity-key`
  - See: `MEDITATION_TIMER_FIXES.md` for detailed analysis
- **Visual issue**: Timer labels are rendering outside the card container
  - Needs investigation: Check DOM structure and container divs
  - Likely: Section headers (h2) need proper container wrapping
  - See: `MEDITATION_TIMER_FIXES.md` for investigation steps
