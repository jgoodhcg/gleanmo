# Gleanmo Roadmap Index

## Goal
Build a personal tracking system that is fast, reliable, and fully owned (no Airtable dependency).

## Current focus
Improve the main dashboard recent list view (visual density and clarity).

- [Data migration status](./data-migration-status.md)
- [Performance monitoring](./performance.md)
- [Infrastructure move (Neon to DigitalOcean)](./infrastructure.md)
