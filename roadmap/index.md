# Gleanmo Roadmap Index

## Goal
Build a personal tracking system that is fast, reliable, and fully owned (no Airtable dependency).

## Current focus
Improve the main dashboard recent list view (visual density and clarity).

## Active roadmap links
- [Task management](./task-management.md)
- [Calendar](./calendar.md)
- [Exercise tracking](./exercise.md)
- [Data migration status](./data-migration-status.md)
- [Performance monitoring](./performance.md)
- [Infrastructure move (Neon to DigitalOcean)](./infrastructure.md)

## Status summary
Core tracking features and timers are live. Near-term focus: define remaining schemas (exercise fix, symptom, reading, bouldering) and wire CRUD, then migrate data from Airtable and other sources one entity at a time. Calendar polish and task management continue in parallel.

## Key links
- [Roadmap structure and catalog](./README.md)
- [Work unit template](./_template.md)
- [Archived roadmap entries](./archived/)
