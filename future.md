# Future Improvements

## CRUD System Redesign
The current CRUD views (generated by crud/routes) need a major overhaul:

**Issues:**
- Take up excessive screen space with poor information density
- Display redundant information across columns  
- Poor visual styling that doesn't match the app's design language
- Lack utility features for efficient data management

**Improvements Needed:**
- **Compact layout**: Higher information density, better use of space
- **Smart columns**: Hide/show relevant fields based on entity type
- **Visual consistency**: Match the app's design system and styling
- **Utility features**: Bulk operations, filtering, sorting, search
- **Responsive design**: Work well on mobile and desktop
- **Action buttons**: More intuitive edit/delete/view controls
- **Data formatting**: Better display of dates, booleans, relationships
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large datasets

**Technical Approach:**
- Consider table virtualization for large datasets
- Implement column customization (hide/show/reorder)
- Add inline editing capabilities
- Improve form layouts within the CRUD system
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Visualization Enhancements

### Clickable Calendar Navigation
- **Goal**: Make calendar heatmap dates clickable to show filtered entity lists
- **Details**: Click on a calendar date to route to filtered CRUD view showing only entities from that specific date
- **Considerations**:
  - Route structure (extend existing CRUD vs new routes)
  - Generic implementation across all temporal entities
  - Date filtering integration with existing CRUD system
  - Back navigation from filtered view to calendar
  - URL format for date parameters

### Additional Chart Types
- **Timeline View**: For interval entities (meditation sessions, exercise)
- **Activity by Day of Week**: Bar chart showing patterns
- **Habit Streaks**: Show consecutive days of habit completion
- **Time of Day Patterns**: When activities typically happen

## Generic Viz System Extensions
- **Multi-entity dashboards**: Combine multiple entity types in single view
- **Custom date ranges**: User-configurable time periods
- **Data export**: Export chart data or images
- **Real-time updates**: Live updating charts


## Roam Integration (Planned)
- **Project schemas**: Connect projects with Roam pages
- **Metrics collection**: Pull todo counts, activity from Roam
- **Time tracking**: Link time tracking to projects
- **Dashboard integration**: Unified project tracking view

## Data-Driven Pattern Improvements
- **Chart configuration validation**: Schema validation for chart configs
- **Performance optimization**: Lazy loading for large datasets
- **Chart lifecycle management**: Proper cleanup and memory management

## Generic Components
- **Fuzzy Search Component**: Reusable search component with fuzzy matching for entity selection across forms and interfaces
  - Support for multiple entity types (projects, exercises, locations, etc.)
  - Keyboard navigation and mobile-friendly interface
  - Configurable search fields and display formatting
  - Recent/frequent item prioritization

### Dark-themed Database Tables
- **Goal**: Make database visualization tables match the dark theme
- **Details**: Update table styling to use dark backgrounds and appropriate contrast

## Big Calendar / Vacation Planning Features

### Google Calendar Sync via iCal URLs
- **Goal**: Integrate with existing iCal URL system for calendar synchronization
- **Questions**: 
  - Pull-only or bidirectional sync?
  - Specific event types to prioritize (vacations, travel, appointments)?
- **Implementation**: Extend existing ical-url entity to display events on big calendar

### Simple Event Creation
- **Goal**: Click on calendar day to create vacation/travel events
- **Questions**:
  - Simple text input modal or inline editing?
  - Event categories/colors (vacation, travel, personal)?
  - Store in database or prepare for calendar sync?
- **Implementation**: Add event entity and click handlers to calendar cells

### Time & Context Features

#### Past Days Indication
- **Goal**: Visually distinguish past dates from future dates
- **Questions**: 
  - Dimmed/faded text or different background opacity?
  - Subtle or obvious distinction?
- **Implementation**: Compare each date with today and apply styling

#### Relative Today Positioning
- **Goal**: Center calendar view around today for better context
- **Questions**:
  - Show 6 months before/after today dynamically?
  - Or full year starting from specific month relative to today?
- **Implementation**: Modify year calculation and month range

### Natural Events & Indicators

#### Solar Events (Equinox/Solstice)
- **Goal**: Mark seasonal transitions for vacation planning
- **Questions**: 
  - Small icons, text labels, or special highlighting?
  - Prominent or subtle indicators?
- **Implementation**: Calculate solar event dates and add indicators

#### First/Last Frost Dates
- **Goal**: Show gardening/outdoor activity relevant dates
- **Questions**:
  - Specific location/hardiness zone configuration?
  - Configurable or default location?
- **Implementation**: Location-based frost date calculation

#### Moon Phases
- **Goal**: Add lunar cycle information
- **Questions**:
  - Small moon icons in corners or background treatment?
  - All phases or just major ones (new, full)?
- **Implementation**: Calculate lunar phases and display indicators

### Priority Implementation Order
1. Simple event creation (core vacation planning functionality)
2. Past days indication (immediate visual improvement)
3. One natural indicator (solar events or moon phases)
4. Google calendar sync (integration with existing systems)

### Calendar Statistics & Analytics
- **Goal**: Provide insights and time-based calculations for vacation/time planning
- **Vacation Analytics**:
  - Time to next weekend (days/hours remaining)
  - Time until next vacation event
  - Total vacations taken this year (count)
  - Mandatory work vacations remaining (requires event type/mandatory field)
  - PTO days taken/remaining (requires PTO day tracking)
- **Temporal Insights**:
  - Time until end of year
  - Time to next holiday
  - Time to next solar/lunar event
- **Implementation**: Dashboard widget or sidebar stats section

### Holiday Management
- **Goal**: Track and highlight personal holidays and celebrations
- **Approach Options**:
  - Events with special `:event/holiday` boolean flag
  - Separate holiday entity type
  - User-configurable holiday calendar
- **Holiday Types**:
